**Blackprint is a 12 column flexbox grid, weighing only 3Kb**

## Getting Started

Blackprint includes all of the basic features of a grid, keeping the ones you'd need and leaving the rest.

### Installing

Simply link to blackprint.min.css before your custom styles, get the files from the /dist folder.

```
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="./ASSETS_FOLDER/blackprint.min.css">
```

Or, work with the Sass file. Choosing this route lets you change some basic options (breakpoints, container width, and margin widths)

```
@import './ASSETS_FOLDER/blackprint.scss';
```
