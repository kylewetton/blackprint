### Installing

Install via

```
npm install --save blackprint

```

Else, simply download/clone this repo and link to blackprint.min.css before your custom styles from the /dist folder.

```
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="./ASSETS_FOLDER/blackprint.min.css">
```

Or, work with the Sass file. Choosing this route lets you change some basic options (breakpoints, container width, and margin widths)

```
@import './ASSETS_FOLDER/blackprint.scss';
```
